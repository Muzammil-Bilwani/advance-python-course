# Week 7 - Database Integration in Django

## 1. Databases

- **Definition**: Organized collections of data that are easily accessible, managed, and updated.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Relational Databases**: Use structured schema and tables to define relationships.
  - **Non-Relational Databases**: Allow for unstructured or semi-structured data storage.
  - **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability â€“ principles of reliable transaction processing.
  - **CAP Theorem**: In distributed databases, you can only achieve two out of three: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance.
- **Types of Operations**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), indexing, partitioning, sharding.

## 2. API and Databases

- **API Definition**: An Application Programming Interface (API) allows different software systems to communicate with each other.
- **Database Interaction**: APIs provide endpoints for database operations like fetching, adding, or updating data.
- **Common Types**:
  - **RESTful APIs**: Communicates with databases using HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - **GraphQL**: A more flexible alternative to REST that allows clients to query exactly what they need.
- **Security**: API/database security involves authentication (OAuth, JWT), rate limiting, and preventing SQL injection attacks.
- **Example**: An API that interacts with a database to retrieve user data based on a request, such as fetching product information in an e-commerce app.

## 3. Types of Databases

- **Relational Databases (SQL)**:
  - Stores data in tables with structured relationships.
  - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
- **Document-Oriented Databases (NoSQL)**:
  - Stores data as documents, typically in JSON or BSON formats.
  - Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.
- **Key-Value Stores**:
  - Simple storage of key-value pairs for fast lookups.
  - Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.
- **Column-Family Databases**:
  - Organizes data into columns and is designed for high-volume reads/writes.
  - Examples: Cassandra, HBase.
- **Graph Databases**:
  - Focuses on relationships between entities, representing data as nodes and edges.
  - Examples: Neo4j, ArangoDB, Dgraph

## 4. SQL (Structured Query Language)

- **Definition**: A domain-specific language used for managing and querying relational databases.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Tables**: Data is stored in rows and columns.
  - **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Used to establish relationships between tables.
  - **CRUD Operations**: Create (INSERT), Read (SELECT), Update (UPDATE), and Delete (DELETE).
  - **Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.).
  - **Transactions**: Ensuring data integrity with COMMIT and ROLLBACK.
  - **Normalization**: Organizing tables to reduce redundancy.
- **Common SQL Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle.

## 5. NoSQL (Not Only SQL)

- **Definition**: A broad category of databases designed for more flexible data models, often used for big data and real-time web applications.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Data Models**: Key-Value, Document, Column-Family, Graph databases.
  - **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling, better suited for large-scale distributed systems.
  - **Schema Flexibility**: Unlike SQL, NoSQL databases can store unstructured or semi-structured data.
  - **Eventual Consistency**: Prioritizes availability and partition tolerance over immediate consistency.
- **Common NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, DynamoDB, Redis.

## 6. Famous Databases

- **MySQL**: A widely-used open-source relational database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Known for its advanced features and strong support for complex queries.
- **MongoDB**: A popular NoSQL document-oriented database.
- **Redis**: An in-memory key-value store used for caching and real-time applications.
- **Cassandra**: A scalable NoSQL column-family database used for big data applications.
- **DynamoDB**: Amazon's managed NoSQL key-value store with high availability and scaling.
